	addon_description=_("""freeAudio is an internet radio, podcast, audio-book, and local music add-on for NVDA that provides seamless access to thousands of internet radio stations via the Radio Browser open directory, RSS/Atom podcast feeds, the libriVox + GETEM digital library for the visually impaired, and your own local audio files and folders through its built-in jukebox. It features a fully accessible station browser with search, country filter, favourites management, and per-station, per-podcast, per-audio-book, and per-jukebox-track audio profiles. Podcast episodes, audio book chapters, and jukebox tracks resume automatically from where you left off - jukebox folders even pick up on the last track you were playing - with adjustable pitch-preserving playback speed and independent pitch-shift (semitone transpose). Playback is handled by BASS, with support for volume control, audio effects, output device selection, and simultaneous audio mirroring to a second device. Additional features include instant and scheduled recording, time-shift rewind of live radio, sleep and alarm timers, automatic ICY metadata announcements, Shazam-based music recognition, and a liked-songs log with lyrics lookup. All controls and shortcuts are designed for NVDA accessibility."""),

## Changelog for 2026.25.4

### New: save the section between two bookmarks as an audio excerpt

- On the Podcasts, Audio Books and Jukebox tabs, mark two or more bookmarks of the same item with `.`, open the bookmark context menu and choose **Save Excerpt Between Marked Bookmarks**. The section from the earliest to the latest marked bookmark (the same section repeat mode loops) is saved as an audio file.
- The file goes to your recordings folder, in a new folder named after the media: the episode title, the book title or the track name. The file name contains the bookmark names and positions, e.g. `Bookmark 1 - Bookmark 2 (1.23-4.56).mp3`. Existing files are never overwritten.
- The excerpt keeps the original format and quality; nothing is re-encoded.
- Saving runs in the background and NVDA announces when it starts and when it is done. The item does not need to be playing.
- Works with downloaded files as well as items that are only streamed. For GETEM books the part is downloaded temporarily to make the cut.
- Uses the ffmpeg that comes with freeAudio. The **ffmpeg.exe path** setting now also applies to excerpts.
- The command is available from the context menu only; it has no keyboard shortcut.
